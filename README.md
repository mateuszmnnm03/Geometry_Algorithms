# Geometric Algorithms

Repository from geometric algorithms course, including:
-  Jarvis and Graham Algorithms for Convex Hull Problem
-  Polygon Triangulation Algorithm
-  Plane Sweep Algorithm for Computing Line Segment Intersections
-  Delaunay Triangulation Algorithm with comparison with monotone polygon triangulation

Projects feature visualization which also enables user input

## Delaunay Triangulation Project

Project allows user defined input - defined, by clicking mouse left button in the window below:

Project include various input data types, such as points on a circle, ona a wave, completely random.
Then, it uses implemented Delaunay algorithm to output such triangulation of these points, that returned
triangles are as close to equilateral triangle as possible (minimises maximal angle of triangle).
Some of the output look like that:

### How to run

To run the project (and other ones) follow these steps:
- clone the repo
- open selected folder in your IDE or Jupyter Notebook
- install required libraries, such as Numpy, Matplotlib
- run cells by either clicking the "run" button, ot by Shift + Enter
