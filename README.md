# Geometric Algorithms

Repository from geometric algorithms course, including:
-  Jarvis and Graham Algorithms for Convex Hull Problem
-  Polygon Triangulation Algorithm
-  Plane Sweep Algorithm for Computing Line Segment Intersections
-  Delaunay Triangulation Algorithm with comparison with monotone polygon triangulation

Projects feature visualization which also enables user input
